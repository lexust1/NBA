# NBA

This repository is related to the NBA topic and Machine Learning.

## The Repository Structure

The repository includes the following `.ipynb` files:

### [01_problem_definition.ipynb](01_problem_definition.ipynb)
This notebook outlines the primary goals and objectives of the analysis.

### [02_data_collection.ipynb](02_data_collection.ipynb)
This file is dedicated to the data collection process. It includes steps to gather, clean, and prepare NBA data from various sources for analysis.

### [03_data_exploration_p1.ipynb](03_data_exploration_p1.ipynb)
The first part of data exploration is dedicated to the exploration of the NBA SQLite database.

### [04_data_exploration_p2.ipynb](04_data_exploration_p2.ipynb)
The second part of data exploration is dedicated to the exploration of the NBA PostgreSQL database, collected over API.

### [05_data_exploration_p3.ipynb](05_data_exploration_p3.ipynb)
The third part of data exploration is dedicated to the identification of patterns, trends, and statistical analysis.

### [06_linear_and_polynomial_regression.ipynb](06_linear_and_polynomial_regression.ipynb)
This notebook focuses on implementing and evaluating linear and polynomial regression models, exploring relationships between various features in the NBA data.

### [07_tree_algos.ipynb](07_tree_algos.ipynb)
This notebook focuses on implementing and evaluating models like the decision tree, random forest, gradient boosted trees, and XGBoost.

### [08_nn_algos.ipynb](08_nn_algos.ipynb)
This notebook focuses on neural network models, applying techniques like various architectures, dropout, regularization, learning rate reduction, and early stopping.

### [09_clustering.ipynb](09_clustering.ipynb)
This notebook focuses on clustering with two or more features, employing the elbow method and K-means.

### [10_anomaly_detection.ipynb](10_anomaly_detection.ipynb)
This notebook is dedicated to anomaly detection with two or more features, using the Elliptic Envelope and Gaussian Mixture Model.

Additionally, there are a few folders:
- The `figures` folder contains images for some `.ipynb` files.
- The `reports` folder holds data profiling reports that can be opened in any browser.
- The `sql_scripts` folder includes several useful SQL queries related to the PostgreSQL Database.
- The `utils` folder contains several Python files that are excluded from `.ipynb` files to avoid overloading them with code. Links to these files are included in the `.ipynb` files.
